This is an app I was taugh through a wonderful course on Youtube. I needed a refresher on the Firebase Flutter API's and this was a great start. It uses Firestore to store a `brews` collection in which each document stores a `name`, `strength` and `sugars` property. The `UserData` and `Brew` models use this data to populate the view. Firestore is also used for authentication with the help of the really cool [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package on [pub.dev].
